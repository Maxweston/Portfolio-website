About

Hi, I'm Max, I am currently a Freelance Front-end Web developer. I am self taught and although my main strengths lie more in programming I also have a thirst for good design.
I have worked on several projects, with each one trying, if possible use a newly learned skill or tool with the goal in mind of being a fully fledged full-stack developer.
My projects try to be as faithful to best practises as possible and I always use responsive and accessible design from the start.

Here are a collection of the skills I am familiar with and have used in my work:

Front-end Development.

	I have a good grounding in the basics of front-end web development, usually trying to keep everything as simple and clear as possible.

	In more recent projects, I have started using SASS and occasionally using J-query as both speed up work-flow and give better code structure and browser support when used correctly.

Server side

	Although I'm relativity new to using PHP, I have used small amounts of it in projects in order to create working contact forms.

Design
	Although my main skill's lean more towards coding, I really enjoy creating icons within Adobe Illustrator© and I am starting to familiarise myself with Adobe Photoshop© to do any image editing.


Development Tools

	I have very recently begun to adopt using Git to more easily control the development process.
	

	
WORK

	This is freelance work I have completed.
	
	
	Panyc

	Complete Website Redesign

	Panyc is a software development company for which I supplied a full website redesign from scratch. 
	using some of the text from the previous build; the aim was to incorporate more modern web development techniques that were not available at the time of development of the websites last version (such as responsive web development).

	the website also employed a gallery like structure to display work and projects it had finished and give an insight into work specifics for potential future business.

	the project was made just using plain old HTML and CSS with a tiny bit of JavaScript to enhance certain aesthetics. 
	A small amount of PHP was used in order to make a working contact form.
	
	I also provided a logo re-design and creation of select graphics to be used on the site.

Skills Used

	HTML5. CSS3. PHP. Adobe Illustrator©. Javascript. JQuery. Adobe Photoshop©.
